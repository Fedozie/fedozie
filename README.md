<p>
I am a creative and self-starting Front-End Developer with flexible, reliable and excellent timekeeping skills and a keen eye for turning designs into dynamic and responsive web apps. I look forward to working in a highly collaborative environment to meet the firm’s objectives while improving my technical skills.

I am currently building with Next JS, and React JS with Typescript. I am adept at styling with vanilla CSS and also familiar with Tailwind CSS and CSS Frameworks. I frequently publish articles on the little things I have come to learn on my <a href = "https://fynnbarr.hashnode.dev/">hashnode blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am open to entry-level front-end developer roles, to learning more and to being mentored. I am also available to collaborate on any projects.
</p>

<p>You can reach me via <a href = "https://twitter.com/fynnbarr"> twitter</a> and <a href = "mailto:pyhnnedo@gmail.com">mail</a>.</p>

<p>
Apart from coding, I like to think I am an exciting person in real life 😁. I am super into sports, athleticism and movies. I like to travel, sightsee and learn about people, their language and culture. I like to try out new cooking recipes and I love Football Club Barcélona with my whole heart.
