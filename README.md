<h2> Hello there 👋🏾, I am Edozie Onyeanusi. </h2>

<p>
I am a frontend developer and a technical writer. I'm currently building with React JS, learning more about other Web Technologies, API Documentation and more about Javascript. I frequently publish articles on the little things I have come to know on my <a href = "https://fynnbarr.hashnode.dev/">hashnode blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am open to learning more, to being mentored and especially, open to entry-level frontend developer roles. I am also open to collaborating in any  projects I can.
</p>

<p>You can reach me via <a href = "https://twitter.com/fynnbarr"> twitter</a> and <a href = "mailto:pyhnnedo@gmail.com">mail</a>.</p>

<p>
Apart from coding, I like to think I am interesting person in real life 😁. I am super into sports, athleticism and movies. I also love to travel around and learn about people, their language and their culture.
</p>
