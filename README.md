## Hello there 👋🏾, I am Edozie Onyeanusi. 

I am a frontend developer and a technical writer. I'm currently building with React JS, learning more about other Web Technologies, API Documentation and more about Javascript. I frequently publish articles on the little things I have come to know on my [hashnode blog](https://fynnbarr.hashnode.dev/). 

I am open to learning more, to being mentored and especially, open to entry-level frontend developer roles. I am also open to collaborating in any  projects I can.

You can reach me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/fynnbarr) and [mail](mailto:pyhnnedo@gmail.com).

Apart from coding, I like to think I am interesting person in real life 😁. I am super into sports, athleticism and movies. I also love to travel around and learn about people, their language and their culture.
